Prediction_notebook1: XGBoost model, Decision Tree classifier<br>
Prediction_notebook2: Neral networks<br>
Prediction_notebook3: XGBoost model, AdaBoost, Gradientmodel

The neural networks algorithm did not perforem well with the collected data. Other machine learning models where tested in order to find better prediction model. The results from XGBoost model are better than Decision tree classifier, that's why this model was used for the final prediction.
